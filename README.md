## Process Model: CRISP-DM on the AWS Stack

CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process -  Data Mining)

+ Business understanding
+ Data understanding
+ 

### AWS Services for data understanding:
In the past, data exploration often meant loading the dataset into redshift tableau or ec2 instances then diving into them through libraries such as ggplot or matplotlib. Today some of these tasks can be addressed in AWS without the need to load the data into a data warehouse or hadoop masternode or downloading the data onto your box. Here are the key servises helping us with data quality and visualizations:

+ Athena
+ QuickSight
+ Glue

#### Glue:
+ managed serverless ETL service
+ includes three components:
  	+ build data catalog
  	+ generate and edit transformations
  	+ schedule and run jobs
#### Athena:
+ interactive query service
+ runs interactive SQL queries on S3 data
+ schema-on-read
+ supports ANSI SQL operators and functions
+ serverless
